I\'m focusing on the various pricing tiers: the pay-as-you-go API, Pro subscription, and enterprise offerings. The API\'s pricing per token and the varying rates for input and output, along with the "Effort" parameter, are critical points. I also noted the value of subscription plans for individuals and enterprise teams. Finally, the example API cost versus the Pro cost gives insight.\n\n\n' thought=True thought_signature=None video_metadata=None
